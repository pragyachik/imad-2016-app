                <p>The bird festival starts at 5 am tomorrow. People of all nationalities are invited. All bird owners are encouraged to bring their bird along with them. The purpose of this parade is to find the healthiest, prettiest and smartest bird through interesting social experiments while giving the birds and their owners a great time. Food and shelter will be provided to upto 1000 little birdies. Donations for future events of this sort are encouraged. This web page is dedicated to future discussions on this topic amongst all the participating bird-lovers. Have a good day!
